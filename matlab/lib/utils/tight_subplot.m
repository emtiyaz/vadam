% tight_subplot creates "subplot" axes with adjustable gaps and margins
%
% [ha, pos] = tight_subplot(Nh, Nw, gap, marg_h, marg_w)
%
%   in:  Nh      number of axes in hight (vertical direction)
%        Nw      number of axes in width (horizontaldirection)
%        gap     gaps between the axes in normalized units (0...1)
%                   or [gap_h gap_w] for different gaps in height and width 
%        marg_h  margins in height in normalized units (0...1)
%                   or [lower upper] for different lower and upper margins 
%        marg_w  margins in width in normalized units (0...1)
%                   or [left right] for different left and right margins 
%
%  out:  ha     array of handles of the axes objects
%                   starting from upper left corner, going row-wise as in
%                   subplot
%        pos    positions of the axes objects
%
%  Example: ha = tight_subplot(3,2,[.01 .03],[.1 .01],[.01 .01])
%           for ii = 1:6; axes(ha(ii)); plot(randn(10,ii)); end
